# Check for import csv file
  # If Exists: Import data from csv
  # If Doesn't Exist: Import data from sample csv

# Verify numbers are acceptable (all are numbers, coordinates are positive)

# Identify which wells have the highest lowest and middle head 

# Calculate distance between highest and lowest using geopy
  # geopy.distance.distance example:
    # newport_ri = (41.49008, -71.312796)
    # cleveland_oh = (41.499498, -81.695391)
    # print(distance.distance(newport_ri, cleveland_oh).feet)


# Calculate point on that line of equipotential with middle head

# Calculate azimuthal direction of flow normal to the equipotential line
